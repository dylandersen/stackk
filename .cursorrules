When building new components or pages, always use the context7 mcp server to understand how you should build stuff and use it if you get stuck.

Additionally, please use skeleton loading animations always when building new pages or features. Instead of a pause when navigating to a new page, navigate to the new page and show the skeleton loading anims instead of anything else.
